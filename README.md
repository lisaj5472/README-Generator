# Professional README Generator

This application is a command-line tool that dynamically generates a professional `README.md` file based on user input. Developed as part of the University of Denver Coding Boot Camp, it streamlines the process of creating high-quality documentation for GitHub projects. Some code and design elements were provided by the University of Denver Coding Boot Camp educational team as part of the course curriculum.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
